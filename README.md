# plutaniumSmsServer
Plutanium SMS Server is a daemon which connects to your USB 3G modem and Gmail and lets you forward your Gmail to SMS, and SMS to SMS, making your own smart SMS gateway. Your GSM modem can be hooked up on local or remote machine, or on Mikrotik router. Implemented as a linux daemon, written in Python.

Only documentation is open sourced at the moment. If you are interested in the library let me know!

###Gmail2SMS
* connect to Gmail with Gmail API (you must generate access token)
* send emails do Gmail from your app, email title=targer number, body=sms content
* edit the Inbox query â€“ filter senders, labels, etc.
* Gmail is then used as a realiable FIFO queue
* daemon will fetch one unread email every N seconds, send it as SMS and set as read

###SMS redirect
Very useful feature since GSM carriers don't offer redirecting SMS, unline call redirect which is a standard GSM feature.

* detect keywords to update active destination number

###Gmail2SMS + SMS redirect
Just set up both. :-)

##Access GSM modem on a remote machine
Going to have GSM modem hooked up to a different machine than the location you'll going to run the daemon on?
Share serial port of the GSM modem over the network and create a virtual serial port at the daemons side.
