# plutaniumSmsServer
Plutanium SMS Server is a daemon which connects to your USB 3G modem and Gmail and lets you forward your Gmail to SMS, and SMS to SMS, making your own smart SMS gateway. Your GSM modem can be hooked up on local or remote machine, or on Mikrotik router. Implemented as a linux daemon, written in Python, tested on Debian and OS X.

Only documentation is open sourced at the moment. If you are interested in the library let me know!

  Very useful feature since GSM carriers don't offer redirecting SMS, unline call redirect which is a standard GSM feature.

* Send info-sms from the gateway and make sure you won't miss any calls and sms sent back to the gateway number. Redirect everything to your work mobile number.
